                            <p>Concerts are crazy fun. There is so much to enjoy about them.
                                You can sing, dance, eat, drink and experience the beautiful atmosphere.
                                What I enjoy the most is being around the people I love and having the most
                                special time together. What's more fun then listening to loud music with
                                people who also enjoy loud music?
